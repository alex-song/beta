#File Repository Service

File Repository Service (FRS), which is built on top of Springboot and MongoDB.

### As a learning project, here is the initial plan (30-Mar-2018):

>       1. setup the dev env, integrate MongoDB to persist the relationship
>       4. back ground housekeeping
>       5. authentication/authorization
>       6. metering, audit, etc
>       
>       
>       The goal is to implement/deploy a service in docker.

How to do it? ;-)
