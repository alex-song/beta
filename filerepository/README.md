#File Repository Service

File Repository Service (FRS), which is built on top of Apache Jackrabbit. It integrates MongoDB.

### As a learning project, here is the initial plan (25-Mar-2018):

>       1. setup the dev env, including a runnable Jackrabbit repository
>       2. basic client and service on top of Jackrabbit
>       3. integrate MongoDB to persist the relationship
>       4. back ground housekeeping
>       5. authentication/authorization
>       6. metering, audit, etc
>       
>       
>       The goal is to implement/deploy a service in docker.

How to do it? ;-)
